# UofT Course Copilot

We are planning to build a course rating and review database platform, especially for the University of Toronto. Our platform for courses is similar to IMDB for movies or ratemyprofessors.com for professors.

----

### Features

* A detailed page for each course in the university, where users can view and contribute rating (from 1 star to 5 stars) for the course. The users can also browse, post, and rate (like / dislike) comments for the course. The overall rating is calculated and displayed based on the individual ratings. By default, most-liked reviews for a course are displayed on top.
* The page also displays other general information for the course, which allows the platform to not only be a review website, but also a general course information database.
* A page for each professor in the university, which cross-references the courses that the professor teaches, and vice versa. This allows the users to get a better picture of the quality of the professor.
* Viewing the information will not require user login. To post comments and ratings, users can easily log in using Facebook or Google accounts.

### Target Users

Our target users are university students and professors at UofT. We are aiming at the following types of users:
* students who are trying to find recommendations and peerâ€™s opinions about courses to help them decide which ones to take;
* students who have taken some courses and would like to share their opinions;
* professors who would like to see feedback from students in their courses.

### Motivation

Our product is a platform for course reviews that help users plan which courses to take. It solves a constantly re-occurring problem for university students -- obtaining critical and quality information about courses in order to make a better decision -- directly and effectively.

As of today, students use the following methods to solve the same problem:
* Asking their friends who have taken the course to get their opinions;
* Search or post on Reddit for course review posts;
* Find the professor of the course and use www.ratemyprofessors.com.

However, none of the currently used methods directly solves these problems:
* It might be hard to find personal friends who took the course before;
* Reddit contains a lot of information and posts which are irrelevant, and useful reviews are scattered and hard to discover;
* The quality of a course remains consistent while the professor for that course changes frequently, hence using the rating for professors as a metric to measure course quality is inaccurate.
