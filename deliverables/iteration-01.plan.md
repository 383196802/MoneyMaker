## Process

#### Artifacts

* A Trello board for organizing TODO lists and objectives



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

(Ordered from most to least important)

Goal:
* Finalize product idea and requirements
* Make clear of the target users
 * Find methods to visualize or present our idea

Tasks:
* Find alternative products that are similar to ours and interview students for their user-experience about these products
* Decide on a list of features that we will implement for the minimum viable product
* Design a list of personas
* Produce artifacts for the product

<!--
 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.
-->

#### Artifacts

* Produce mock-up screenshots of the main pages of our platform.
* Produce `product.md` that describes our product in more detail.

<!--
List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
